ideas for the neutron sound dodeca.

ringifier: 		output modified "strummed" chords for rings poly 4 mode. 
ringifier8 		output 2CVs covering 8 notes on 2 rings.
syncLFO: 		sync LFOs with variable waveform, and rate depending on note and velocity.
clockdivider: 		synced to MIDI clock, each output is a multiplication or division:
pattern generator: 	drum pattern generator with parameters changed by note and velocity  
bunch of envelopes.	envelopes per note across octave, velocity > decay, other params by mod and CC.
drum env and trig. 	6 envelopes and triggers. make drums with a VCA and an oscillator.
